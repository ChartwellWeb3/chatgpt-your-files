#### Shopping for retirement homes?

Rome differed from [Greek city-states](/wiki/Greek_city-states 'Greek city-states') in allowing freed slaves to become citizens; any future children of a freedman were born free, with full rights of citizenship. After manumission, a slave who had belonged to a Roman citizen enjoyed active political freedom _(libertas)_, including the right to vote. His former master became his patron _([patronus](/wiki/Patronage_in_ancient_Rome 'Patronage in ancient Rome'))_: the two continued to have customary and legal obligations to each other. A freedman was not entitled to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but could play a [priestly role](/wiki/Augustales 'Augustales'). He could not marry a woman from a senatorial family, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that [Hadrian](/wiki/Hadrian 'Hadrian') limited their participation by law. The rise of successful freedmen---through political influence or wealth---is a characteristic of early Imperial society. The prosperity of a high-achieving group of freedmen is attested by [inscriptions throughout the Empire](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Liberti_and_libertae_in_Ancient_Roman_inscriptions 'commons:Category:Liberti and libertae in Ancient Roman inscriptions'), and by their ownership of some of the most lavish houses at [Pompeii](/wiki/Pompeii 'Pompeii').

### Census rank

There are many important factors to consider when trying to find the best retirement community for yourself or a loved one. Practical considerations like location, cost and the right support or care services for your unique needs, emotional considerations like how the residence made you feel and your interactions with staff, and so much more. Read our helpful guide today for questions to ask during a tour, topics to discuss with family, and how to make a decision you can feel confident in.

#### Unequal justice

As the republican principle of citizens\' equality under the law faded, the symbolic and social privileges of the upper classes led to an informal division of Roman society into those who had acquired greater honours _(honestiores)_ and humbler folk _(humiliores)_. In general, _honestiores_ were the members of the three higher \"orders,\" along with certain military officers. The granting of universal citizenship in 212 seems to have increased the competitive urge among the upper classes to have their superiority affirmed, particularly within the justice system. Sentencing depended on the judgment of the presiding official as to the relative \"worth\" _(dignitas)_ of the defendant: an _honestior_ could pay a fine for a crime for which an _humilior_ might receive a [scourging](/wiki/Scourging 'Scourging').

Execution, which was an infrequent legal penalty for free men under the Republic, could be quick and relatively painless for _honestiores_, while _humiliores_ might suffer the kinds of torturous death previously reserved for slaves, such as [crucifixion](/wiki/Crucifixion 'Crucifixion') and [condemnation to the beasts](/wiki/Damnatio_ad_bestias 'Damnatio ad bestias'). In the early Empire, those who converted to Christianity could lose their standing as _honestiores_, especially if they declined to fulfil religious responsibilities, and thus became subject to punishments that created the conditions of [martyrdom](/wiki/Christian_martyrs 'Christian martyrs').
